# 3D-design-mouth

# Overview
Here I have attempted to design a 3D robot mouth, therefore this project contains a design for a robot mouth that was created using the "shapr3d" platform. The design includes several components that come together to form the robot's mouth movement, including a motor behind the lower jaw
